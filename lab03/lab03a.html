            There is a fairly big difference between making a webpage responsive using CSS Media Queries and using Bootstrap. Personally, 
            it was quite hard to do the media queries. I had to constantly check the width of the viewport and ensure that my design was 
            responsive for that specific viewport. For my webpage, I used 3 different breakpoints: desktop, tablet, and mobile. I initally made my 
            css design for a desktop and then had to resize my window to see when the design was breaking, and change the design, so that it was better 
            suited for the width of the window size. I had to constantly change the padding, margin, and font-sizes for each breakpoint which became very inefficient. 
            Furthermore, there were times were the CSS styling was not cooperating with me, which started to become quite painful.

            On the other hand, using Bootstrap was a lot easier because Bootstrap has a built-in feature that is used to develop responsive webpages. I didn't 
            need to change the design depending on the window size, because Bootstrap already was taking care of that for me. All I needed to do was create one design 
            and that design would be used for all window sizes, regardless of how big or small the window is. This made my life a lot easier. 
            I already knew CSS from highschool, so learning Bootstrap at first was a little bit of a learning curve, but I quickly got the 
            hang of it. I enjoyed using bootstrap a lot more and it was a lot easier on my end. Furthermore, Bootstrap took a lot less time for me to
            implement. When using media queries, it took a lot of time to change the styling to something I liked, but with the Bootstrap framework, 
            it was a lot easier to design my webpage.
