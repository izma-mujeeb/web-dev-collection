                Nepal is located in the Himalayas between India and China. It is bordered by China's Tibet region to the north and India to the 
                east, west and south. It is a landlocked country whose length goes from west to east and width goes from north to south. Nepal 
                is one of the smaller countries in the Indian Peninsula. It is not often heard of in the world stage because of its isolated 
                location, rugged interior and its remoteness. It is located in the midst of the rough Himalayas. As a result of these features, 
                Nepal didn't merge with any of the bigger political entities in the Indian Peninsula. It remained almost isolated for centuries 
                since its borders were first demarked in the 18th century. The country is divided into five regions that are the eastern, central, 
                western, midwestern and far western regions. The regions include 14 provinces that in turn include 75 districts.

                    The weather is cold in elevated areas. There are several mountain summits permanently covered with snow, as temperature goes 
                    below 0Â°C. Lowland areas surrounded by mountains are relatively warm, which encourages most of the population to live there. 
                    The summer is hot in the lowland valleys, cold above the mountains and sees seasonal rain - just like the rest of the Indian 
                    Peninsula. As a result of the great variety of elevation in Nepal, tropical savanna grows along the Indian border in addition 
                    to subtropical broadleaf and coniferous forests in the Hill region and mountain grasslands, shrubs, rock and snow at the 
                    highest elevations.

                    Nepal's geography is rugged and mountainous. It is made up of extremely high mountain ranges extending from west to east and 
                    sometimes from south to north. The height of these mountains ranges between 3000 and 8000 meters. They include the world's 
                    highest mountain summit, Mount Everest, which rises 8848 meters above sea level. The mountain ranges have internal valleys 
                    through which several rivers run. Some valleys have swamps, such as the Terai swamp, whose water flow into the rivers of 
                    Brahmaputra and Ganges. Arable land is estimated at 16.07% of the total area and permanent crops are estimated at around 0.85%.

                    Nepal's population is around 26 million according to a 2024 census. About 36% of the population lives in the central region 
                    that includes capital city Kathmandu. There are several tribes and ethnicities in the Nepal, which is inhabited by around 
                    125 different communities and ethnic groups talking 123 languages and local dialects. Meanwhile, most of the population uses 
                    the official Nepali language. Common people do not normally speak English. Nepal population is equivalent to 0.36% of the total world's 
                    population and it ranks #51 in the list of countries by population. 23.8% of the population in Nepal is urban.

                    There are several religions and deities in Nepal, amounting to around 12 different religions. The majority of the Nepalese 
                    population, about 81%, follows Hinduism, which used to be the official religion of the Kingdom of Nepal before the conversion 
                    to a republic. Buddhism comes second, followed by 9% of the population, then Islam 4.5%, Kirant 3%, and Christianity 1.5%. Other groups, 
                    which together constitute less than 1 percent of the population, include animists, adherents of Bon (a Tibetan religious tradition), Jains, 
                    Baha'is, and Sikhs. Muslims constitute at least 5.5 percent of the population.

                    Nepal turned from a monarchy to a constitutional republic on May 28, 2008. Following the first parliamentary elections in 2008,
                    a president and a vice president were elected. Then a prime minister was appointed and other constitutional entities instated, 
                    such as the Constituent Assembly, which was tasked with writing a new constitution for the country within 4 years. However, the 
                    assembly failed in this task and was dissolved to throw the country in a constitutional crisis that almost pushed it back to the 
                    first square (the civil war period) and blew away everything that was achieved until then.
