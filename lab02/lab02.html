                    <p class = "about-paragraph">Hi there! My name is Izma Mujeeb and I am a second year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. I decided to major in Computer Science because I am fascinated by the world of technology and Artifical Intelligence. I am interested in Web Development, Software Engineering, and Data Analysis. I enjoy working on side projects to expand my skill set and learn new technologies and frameworks. As well, I am actively seeking new experiences that allow me to use my skills in a practical setting.</p>

At my last internship, I hope I can get a return offer, hence I will have a job straight out of university. I am hoping to be working as a software developer and working in a diverse team where I will be able to assist in developing and deploying scalable projects. Furthermore, I hope to continue to grow as a developer and make meaningful contributions and connections with my colleagues.</p>
